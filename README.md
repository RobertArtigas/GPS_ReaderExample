There are three schools of magic. **One:** State a tautology, then ring the changes on its corollaries; that's philosophy. **Two:** Record many facts. Try to see a pattern. Then make a wrong guess at the next fact; that's science. **Three:** Awareness that you live in a malevolent universe controlled by Murphy's Law, sometimes offset in part by Brewster's Factor: that's engineering.<BR/>
